    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods into a single unit called an object. It allows the object to control access to its internal state and behavior, providing data protection and abstraction. Encapsulation helps maintain the integrity of the data and prevents unauthorized access or modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes based on existing classes, allowing the new classes to inherit the properties and methods of the existing classes. This promotes code reuse, extensibility, and the organization of classes into a hierarchy. Inheritance establishes an \"is-a\" relationship between classes, where the derived classes inherit characteristics from their base or parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows methods to be implemented in multiple ways, depending on the specific class of the object. Polymorphism enables code to be written in a generic manner, capable of working with objects of different types. This concept enhances flexibility and enables dynamic behavior based on the actual type of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on providing a simplified representation of complex systems by emphasizing relevant information and hiding unnecessary details. It allows the creation of abstract classes or interfaces that define common attributes and behaviors without specifying the implementation. Abstraction enables modular and high-level design, enabling programmers to work at a conceptual level, separate from the nitty-gritty implementation details."
